My current idea involves taking advantages of prefixes suffixes and making maps to correlate |

I am using the java built in Hashtable class. Right now I have the for loop that for every word if it is in the hash table add 1 to the value or else add a new entry |
| December 3 | 0700-0730 | I use one reigning champ to find the highest value in the table then I find the key associated with that value. Now when I actually writing, I used the array of split words and for that lenght, I check if it is the most common word if it is I write an @ as my escape character otherwise I write the current word then a space. In expand I read in the length of the special word and then for that length I read characters until I construct my special word. Next, I read in the complete text as a string and split it based on my escape character. Lastly I iterate through the array of strings and I write a word then I write my special word until the end. There is an edge case where if the word is at the end it won't get read, but I am assuming there is a period at the end which will prevent this from happening |

I started to keep track of a second word and encode it at the front. However in expand I have issues because when I split I don't know what to write. I think I will just iterate character by character and look for my two escape characters |

I think this method will only be effective If I compress the first 30+ words. I want to sort the hashmap and code it to make escape keys with numbers in the later alphabet. Right now I don't know how to do that. I am trying to get the keys and values in arrays. |

My idea is to put the hashtable into an arraylist of pair objects and then I do a reigning champ while an array that contains the thirty words I want to encrypt. The array would only be of strings as now the number of repitions is irrelevant. Then I assign the last 30 ascii values to those words and compress like I was doing before. The hashtable up front would be pretty beefy and the expanding will just be a massive switch case. |
